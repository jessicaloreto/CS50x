# Ladybug and ballerina

It's an interactive story and the sprites are: a ladybug, a ballerina and a radio. The ballerina asks if the ladybug wants to see her dancing. So, if the answer is yes the ballerina is going to dance, otherwise if the answer is other different from yes, the ballerina disapears.
